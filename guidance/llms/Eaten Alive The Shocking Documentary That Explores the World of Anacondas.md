Eaten Alive is not for the faint of heart, as it shows Rosolie wearing a custom-made suit that protects him from the snake's powerful jaws and digestive juices. Rosolie also has a camera attached to his helmet, which captures his point of view as he enters the mouth of the anaconda. The documentary also explores the fascinating biology and behavior of anacondas, which are among the largest and most mysterious predators on Earth.
 
Eaten Alive sparked a lot of controversy and criticism from animal rights activists, who claimed that the stunt was cruel and harmful to the snake. Rosolie defended his actions, saying that he had the permission of local authorities and that he did not harm the snake in any way. He also said that his goal was to raise awareness and funds for the conservation of the Amazon rainforest and its wildlife.
 
Eaten Alive is available to watch online in mp4 format, which is compatible with most mobile devices.

Eaten Alive is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you wonder about the secrets of nature.
  
In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the scenes and facts that Eaten Alive reveals about anacondas and their habitat. We will also discuss some of the challenges and risks that Rosolie and his team faced during their expedition.
 
## How Big Are Anacondas?
 
Anacondas are a type of boa constrictor, which means that they kill their prey by wrapping their muscular bodies around them and squeezing them until they suffocate. Anacondas are native to South America, where they live in swamps, marshes, and rivers. They are semi-aquatic, which means that they can swim and dive underwater for long periods of time.
 
Anacondas are the heaviest snakes in the world, weighing up to 250 kilograms (550 pounds). They can also grow to be very long, reaching up to 9 meters (30 feet) in length. However, the exact size of anacondas is hard to measure, as they are very elusive and rarely seen in the wild. Most of the specimens that have been captured or killed were females, which are larger than males.
 
Eaten Alive features a legendary anaconda named Chumana, which Rosolie believes to be the world's longest. Chumana is estimated to be over 10 meters (33 feet) long, based on the tracks and sightings of local people. Rosolie and his team spent weeks searching for Chumana in a remote location of the Amazon rainforest in Peru, where they encountered many dangers and difficulties.
